# face_mask_detection
This project focuses on building a Face Mask Detection System using Deep Learning techniques with the VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The model aims to accurately classify whether a person is wearing a mask or not wearing a mask, contributing to public health and safety measures.
